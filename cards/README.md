Deck of Cards

Approach: Followed along in class. I was pretty much baffled as to how to go about doing this from scratch, and I ran out of time to do it last night. :( Maybe after watching this done a couple times I'll understand it better and be able to do it on my own.

Collaborators/Sources: Brook, class
