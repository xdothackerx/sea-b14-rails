Approach: followed through the Workflowy with the project folder structure tree on Canvas as a guide. Asked around about how other people were doing; tried to ask TA (Ramen) how to fix my rake test for the capybara (google search) test, but he was as baffled as I was. After changing it to look like the original sample it still didn't work, but upon changing it back to my original version it finally did (WHY!?!?!).

Collaborators: Tony, Ramen, Steve, Charlie (not a CF student but...)
